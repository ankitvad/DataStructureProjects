<h1>Description:</h1>
<br>
<p>
Contains:
1.) Sieve_Of_Eratothenes:<br>A project that uses the sieve algorithm, and uses data containers such as Linked List, Array and a Binary Search Tree<br>and, calculates the time for upper-bound insertions and deletions, and also plots the graph, proving for what vaues, which method/container<br>is better and more efficient.

2.) Batman and Joker:<br>
It's a modification to the Cos and Robbers/Maze-Theory game.<br>It asks users for the bstrution points in the maze, and the start and end point, ie. The position for Batman and Joker, after this it uses Breadth_First_Search / Depth_First_Search, to show if a path exists or not, and the use Djikstras to calculate the shortest distane, and then prints that.
<br>:It also contains a ifty C++ loader, that can be seen to check real-life System-Memory utilisation(quite-memory-intensive).
<br>PS: Unfortunately, i have'nt added a function and filestream techniques to automatically take in the obstructions<br>so the larger the matrix size, more intense and time-consuming is the insertions. But i will work on it, as soon as i get time<-maybe->..
