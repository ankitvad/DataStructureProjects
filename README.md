Sieve Of Eratothenes: Comparing Prime Number Generation Algorithm and Container Data Structure for Different Number input Upper Bounds. 
<br>
Creating the Prime Number Generation Algorithm by the Nested-For loop Tehnique, and, Sieve of Eratosthenes approach and check for their optimality(..W.R.T time-taken)<br>
for different Upper Bound I/P numbers. Also, after attaining the optimality consider different Container(Data Structure) structures<br>
for storing the Number Set, namely a Linked List and a Binary Search Tree and then check for their Optimality(..WRT time-taken). 

Batman and Joker:
Creating a Static/Algorithm Generated Cops and Robber game. it generates whether in a grid/maze(..user generated) consisting of open spaces<br>
as well as obstacles, there exists a path between Batman ad Joker, and if it does, what is the optimal/shortest path<br>
to take(..considering that the destination ie. Joker stays still in the field.).
The Program makes use of Map, Templates and Vector STL continers. It checks for the path availability through BFS and DFS techniques; and, calculates<br>
the path through Djikstras Algorithm.<br>

TO DO: In Batman and Joker: create a random number generation with which to automatically generate a matrix/grid.
